This is intended to connect the LTE Hinged External Antenna - 698MHz-2.7GHz.</li> <li>Cell 2 \u2014 The SMA Connector labled as Cell 1 is for the u-blox LARA-R606. This connection represents the secondary RF input for LTE/3G Rx diversity and LTE MIMO 2x2 down-link RF signals reception. This is intended to connect the second LTE Hinged External Antenna - 698MHz-2.7GHz.</li> <li> <p>GNSS \u2014 The SMA connector labeled as GNSS is for the u-blox ZED-F9P and NEO-D9S. This is connected to a GNSS splitter (Power Divider) and allows you to connect a single GNSS antenna for both modules. This is intended to connect an active multiband GNSS antenna using the SMA male to TNC male interface cable that is included in the kit. The RTK EVK provides 5V on this connector for an active multiband antenna instead of the usual 3.3V. Short-circuit and open-circuit detection is built into this connection as well. The following icons will flash whenever the RTK EVK does not detect an antenna (i.e. an open circuit) or if there is a short in the cable.

These jumpers connect the USB Type C connector's shield pin to GND. By default, these are closed. Cut this to isolate the USB Type C connector's shield pin for the ESP32 and the ZED-F9P.</li> <li>MEAS \u2014 To enable measurements and determine how much power the RTK EVK uses, we've added a NC (normally closed) jumper between the two MEAS PTH pins. By cutting this jumper, the voltage connecting to the 3.3V voltage regulator input is interrupted. Soldering in a male jumper or wires into the accompanying holes will give you the ability to insert a current meter and precisely monitor how much current your application is consuming.</li> <li>VIN+ \u2014 The VIN+ jumper connects the I/O Screw Terminal to the 5V DC-DC converter's VIN+ pin. This is closed by default. Cut this trace to disable the connection.</li> <li>VIN- \u2014 The VIN- jumper connects the I/O Screw Terminal to the 5V DC-DC converter's VIN- pin. This is closed by default. Cut this trace to disable the connection.</li> <li>PW+ \u2014 The PW+ jumper connects the RJ45 MagJack's PW+ pin to the DP9905 PoE's VIN+ pin. This is closed by default. Cut this trace to disable the connection.</li> <li>PW- \u2014 The PW- jumper connects the RJ45 MagJack's PW- pin to the DP9905 PoE's VIN- pin. This is closed by default. Cut this trace to disable the connection.</li> <li>GNSS Reset \u2014 The GNSS reset jumper is open by default. Adding a solder blob will connect the reset button (which is currently only connected to the ESP32's reset pin) to the reset pins on both the ZED-F9P and NEO-D9S. Pulling the pin low by pressing the button will initiate a reset on the ZED-F9P and NEO-D9S. This will delete all information and trigger a cold start. As stated in the integration manual, this should only be used as a recovery option. Compared to the other jumpers, this jumper includes a 1x2 PTH. Users can also break off a 1x2 standard male header and temporarily connect a 1x2 jumper.</li> <li>I<sup>2</sup>C \u2014 This three way jumper labeled <code>I<sup>2</sup>C</code> will connect to two pull-up resistors to the I<sup>2</sup>C data and clock lines when closed. For advanced users that do not have pull-up resistors attached to the I<sup>2</sup>C lines on their microcontroller, make sure to close the jumpers with a little solder blob.</li> <li>POE LOAD \u2014 The POE LOAD creates a dummy load of 100mA on the DC/DC converter output. This is closed by default. Cut this trace to disable the dummy load.</li> <li>WIZnet W5500 Mode Jumper \u2014 For users that want to configure the WIZnet W5500 mode, there are three jumpers available to adjust the network mode. By default, the jumpers are set to 111 or \"All capable, Auto-negotiation.\" For more information on the different modes, check out the WIZnet 5500 datasheet linked in the Resources.<ul> <li>PMODE0 \u2014 Pulled high. Add as solder jumper to pull the pin low.</li> <li>PMODE1 \u2014 Pulled high. Add as solder jumper to pull the pin low.</li> <li>PMODE2 \u2014 Pulled high. Add as solder jumper to pull the pin low.</li> </ul> </li> <li>LED \u2014 The LED jumper connects the status LED to the ESP32's pin 2. This is closed by default. Cut this trace to disable the status LED.</li> <li>LINK \u2014 The LINK jumper connects the RJ45 Link LED to the WIZnet 5500 LINKLED pin. This is closed by default. Cut this trace to disable the RJ45's Link LED.</li> <li>ACT \u2014  The ACT jumper connects the RJ45 Activity LED to the WIZnet 5500 ACTLED pin. This is closed by default. Cut this trace to disable the RJ45's Link LED.</li> <li>3V3 SW EN \u2014 This three way jumper labeled 3V3 SW EN enables the XC6222 3.3V/700mA voltage regulator for the RTK EVK's secondary power to provide power for the RJ45 MagJack LEDs, W5500, ZED-F9P, NEO-D9S, USB Hub, and Qwiic OLED.  By default, the trace is pulled high. Cut the trace and add a solder blob between the center pad and the other jumper to allow the ESP32 to toggle power using pin 32.</li> <li>3V3 SW2 EN \u2014 This three way jumper labeled 3V3 SW2 EN enables the AP7361C 3.3V/1A voltage regulator for the RTK EVK's tertiary power to provide power for the LARA-R6.
